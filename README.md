# Identify Customer Segments

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze demographic data to identify and understand customer segments for a mail-order company. By leveraging data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques, the project reveals insights into the characteristics of the company's customer base compared to the general population.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing demographic data for analysis.
2. **Feature Transformation**: Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and capture key patterns.
3. **Clustering**: Applying k-means clustering to segment customers and draw comparisons with the general population.

> **Note**: The data used in this project is proprietary and cannot be shared. Analysis is performed using Python and popular data science libraries.
