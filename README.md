# Identify Customer Segments

## Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying customer segments for a mail-order company using demographic data from Germany. The analysis involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, applying dimensionality reduction techniques, and using clustering methods to group customers into distinct segments. By comparing the general population's demographics with the mail-order company's customer data, we aim to uncover insights into target audiences and potential markets.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Preprocessing
- Explored and understood the dataset's structure and content.
- Handled missing or unknown values appropriately.
- Removed features and data points with excessive missing data.
- Re-encoded features based on their measurement levels (categorical, ordinal, numeric).
- Applied a systematic cleaning procedure to both general demographic and customer datasets.

### 2. Feature Transformation
- Scaled the features to ensure uniformity in the data.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and identify underlying relationships between variables.
- Interpreted the variability captured by each principal component and selected an optimal number of components for the analysis.

### 3. Clustering
- Used the k-means clustering algorithm to group the general demographic data into distinct segments.
- Applied the same cleaning, scaling, and PCA transformations to the customer data.
- Compared the clustering results of the general demographic data with the customer data to understand market segment distributions.

## What I Learned and Applied

### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
- The importance of identifying and handling missing values to ensure data quality.
- Techniques for encoding categorical and ordinal variables into formats suitable for analysis.
- How to systematically clean datasets for consistency and reliability.

### Dimensionality Reduction
- Learned the significance of feature scaling in machine learning workflows.
- Understood how PCA works to reduce dimensionality while retaining essential information.
- Gained experience interpreting principal components and determining the number of components to retain for analysis.

### Clustering and Market Segmentation
- Applied the k-means clustering algorithm to uncover patterns in demographic data.
- Learned how to evaluate the number of clusters for optimal segmentation.
- Compared and interpreted demographic clusters between general and customer data to derive actionable insights for the mail-order company.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for the project.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **scikit-learn**: For PCA, scaling, and k-means clustering.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Key Takeaways
This project enhanced my understanding of customer segmentation, data preprocessing, and machine learning workflows. I gained practical experience in handling real-world data challenges and applying machine learning techniques to uncover meaningful insights. The skills and knowledge gained here can be applied to various domains involving market segmentation and customer behavior analysis.
